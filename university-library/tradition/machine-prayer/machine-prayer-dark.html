    <p style="text-align: center; font-size:large; color:white; font-family:courier;">Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
    Sovereign King enthroned in Heaven,<br>
    in your love and mercy<br>
    establish a perimeter of protection<br>
    with Your Precious Blood<br>
    around our communication devices<br>
    and all technology used during this session,<br>
    the cameras, microphones, speakers,<br>
    displays, any and all software,<br>
    wired and wireless connections,<br>
    the routers involved in the transmission of data,<br>
    and the light waves being used to transfer data.<br>
    Cleanse them with your precious blood<br>
    and drive from them any satanic influence.<br>
    Establish around them a sanctuary of your mercy<br>
    where Satan and any other evil spirit<br>
    or human agency cannot interfere.<br>
    I ask, Father, that you would block,<br>
    bind, rebuke and render impotent<br>
    any assault of the evil one from them in any way.<br>
    Father, so long as these instruments<br>
    are utilized in this ministry of Divine mercy,<br>
    we ask you to allow them to enjoy the protection<br>
    of the Blessed Mother, St. Anthony Mary Claret,<br>
    St. Michael the Archangel, and all the Holy Angels.<br>
    We ask this in Your Most Holy Name,<br>
    the Name before which every knee shall bow,<br>
    in heaven, on the earth and under the earth,<br>
    that Jesus Christ is Lord.</p>
